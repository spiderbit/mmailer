# Requirements

   - python > 2.7
   - mail-server

Just start it and follow the instructions:

   $ sh mmailer.py

1. you are told to tell mmailer all it needs to connect to your smtp server
* I only testet this with googlemail server
* be aware that mmailer saves your password in cleartext right now in the config.txt file.


In the template file "mail.txt" replace text which is not in all mails the same by a substitude with $ as first sign like this:

   Dear $receiver,

Then run the programm again

   $ sh mmailer.py

mmailer now creates a keys.csv file for you, open it as example with libreoffice
* select utf-8

For each mail you want to send, fill out one line of substitudes.

Save it!

Run mmailer again:

   $ sh mmailer.py

Now it shows you the mails it generated and asks if you want it should send them!

If you like what you see press enter for each mail and mmailer sends them.

Have fun!
